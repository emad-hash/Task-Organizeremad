          <h1>What is Task Managment and why it's so important?</h1>
          <p class="Description">
            Task management is the process of managing a task through its life
            cycle. It involves planning, testing, tracking, and reporting. Task
            management can help either individual achieve goals, or groups of
            individuals collaborate and share knowledge for the accomplishment
            of collective goals. Tasks are also differentiated by complexity,
            from low to high.
          </p>

          <p class="Description">
            In cases when a large team is working on a complex large-scale
            project, different tasks are assigned to different team members. For
            this process to go smoothly, the project manager needs to plan,
            analyze and evaluate tasks on a daily basis.
